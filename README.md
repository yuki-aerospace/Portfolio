I made this program when I conducted Compton Scattering lab in a class. 
- Import 2 .Spe files(background and actual trial).
- Format the file and perform background subtraction.
- Export the resulted data as .csv file.
- Perform Gaussian fit using ```NonlinearModelFit[]``` function, and show fitting parameter and the resulted graph.

The fitting parameter was then used to make a "energy vs angle" graph and calculate its uncertainty to verify Relativistic model of Compton scattering.
  
The detail of the experiment and the resulted graph can be seen from [here]([https://github.com/user/repo/blob/branch/other_file.md](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WI4l42ngp_pML02N_3L0Cc4sF8qouW1r3FyLNdvqsJs/edit))
