## Weather App (Python)

<details>
  <summary> Details </summary>
  
This program is a weather app. Tkinter was used for GUI.

Here is an instruction of how to use this app. 
1. User enters the name of a city.
2. User presses "Look Up City" button.
3. Program gets the weather information and display it on the screen.
4. User can exit the app by pressing "Exit" button.

There is a subprogram, "get_weather.py". 
This program retrive weather information from openweathermap.
The information I retrived was 
- weather condition
- temperature
- humidity
- weather icon
Detail information of the API can be seen from this link. (https://openweathermap.org/current)

## Gaussian Fit (Mathematica)
<details>
  <summary> Details </summary>
  
I made this program when I conducted Compton Scattering lab in a class. 
- Import 2 .Spe files(background and actual trial).
- Format the file and perform background subtraction.
- Export the resulted data as .csv file.
- Perform Gaussian fit using ```NonlinearModelFit[]``` function, and show fitting parameter and the resulted graph.

The fitting parameter was then used to make a "energy vs angle" graph and calculate its uncertainty to verify Relativistic model of Compton scattering.
  
The detail of the experiment and the resulted graph can be seen from this link (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WI4l42ngp_pML02N_3L0Cc4sF8qouW1r3FyLNdvqsJs/edit)
